# Simple-OOP-Examples
Simple examples of OOP concepts for presenting.

This is a part of my presentation on Object Oriented Programming and SOLID principles.
The slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QflDAEXG_O8nnE-yB6_m69YPzoXEarYBa-r5SZlH2Gw/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: This will most likely not compile. This is pseudo-code to show for presentations and demonstration.
